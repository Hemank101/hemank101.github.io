Hi there! My name is Hemanth Koralla (hey-month koraa-LA). I am software developer from Ypsilanti, MI working for the Autnomous Vehicle group General Motors. I have a passion for healthcare robotics, autonomous vehicles, and advanced computing
topics.

"I am the master of my fate. I am the captian of my soul"

This stanza from my favorite poem, Invictus by William Ernst Henley, is how I like to live my life. I am working to make every moment of life intentional and mastered. My ultimate goal is make the largest positive impact on humanity in whatever manner that may be. 

Thanks for checking out my website. I love meeting new people so feel free to send me a message!
