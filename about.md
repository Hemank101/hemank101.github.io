Hi there! My name is Hemanth Koralla (hey-month koral-LA). I am software developer from Ypsilanti, MI working on a new handsfree driver assistance system called Ultra Cruise at General Motors. I have a passion for healthcare robotics, autonomous vehicles, and advanced computing
topics. I am looking to build a career where I can create a positive social impact through computer science and robotics.
